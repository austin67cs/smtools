# ðŸŽ‰ My First Standalone Software  

This project is specialâ€”itâ€™s my **first ever software built completely from scratch**, without relying on external frameworks or libraries.  
Every feature and line of code is a **true product of my own effort and learning**, from the design to the implementation.  

Itâ€™s a small but meaningful milestone, and Iâ€™m proud to share it as part of my journey toward becoming a better programmer. ðŸš€
